# Live_Project
This is a collection of all the code I created during my live project.
<p>All of the code I made was intended for a movie rental website, where I made the Rental History Form and Survey. I utilized Javascript, CSS, and HTML during this project, along with Azure DevOps and Visual Studio. </p>
<h2> Code: </h2>

[Rental History Form](/Rent/Views/RentalHistory/Create.cshtml)
[Rental History Index](/Rent/Views/RentalHistory/Index.cshtml)

<h3> Rental History Form </h3>
<p> This is the form I made using MVC and ASP.NET to create. It will let you input any damages incurred and any details regarding the item. </p>

<h3> Rental History Index </h3>
<p> This is the index page that displays all the forms that have been submitted. CSS and HTML were used to style the page, such as adding a dropdown bar and adding ellipsis to details that are too long. </p>
